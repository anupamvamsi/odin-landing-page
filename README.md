## [Project 2 (TheOdinProject)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/790/)

The project is aimed to test the understanding of HTML and CSS by building a website from scratch, given a design, for example by using a picture.

My implementation of the project covers the basic requirements of understanding and using HTML and CSS, which is exhibited with the website being built close to the specifications provided, which you can take a look [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) and [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png).

The end result of the project is hosted [here](https://anupamvamsi.github.io/odin-landing-page/), using [github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

The dummy content on the website is taken from and provided by The Odin Project's course.
